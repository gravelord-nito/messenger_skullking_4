# Messenger
Simple Object Oriented QT based messanger client as of final project of advanced programming university course at [IUT](https://english.iut.ac.ir/).

You can find the list of all the requests possible in [All request and reply](https://github.com/gravelord-nito/messenger_skullking_4/blob/main/Messenger%20All%20request%20and%20reply%20format.pdf) pdf file.

The UI and request interfaces are completely seperated. You can find the whole request interface and mechanism in [nemidoonam/http](https://github.com/gravelord-nito/messenger_skullking_4/tree/main/nemidoonam/http) and more specifically the main structure at [tools.h](https://github.com/gravelord-nito/messenger_skullking_4/blob/main/nemidoonam/http/tools.h). The so said header file could be included in another QT UI design main or any other desirable framework.

## Notable features
* minimal code
* highly reuseable and customizable
* Telegram like UI
